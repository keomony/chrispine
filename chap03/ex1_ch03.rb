#To store the string in your computer's memory, we need to give the string a name. Programmers often refer to this process as assignment, and they call the names variables. This variable can be just about any sequence of letters and numbers, but the first character needs to be a lowercase letter. Let's try that last program again, but this time I will give the string the name myString (though I could just as well have named it str or myOwnLittleString or henryTheEighth).

myString = '...you can say that again...'
puts myString
puts myString

name = 'Patricia Rosanna Jessica Mildred Oppenheimer'
puts 'My name is ' + name + '.'
puts 'Wow!  ' + name + ' is a really long name!'

composer = 'Mozart'
puts composer + ' was "da bomb", in his day.'

composer = 'Beethoven'
puts 'But I prefer ' + composer + ', personally.'

var = 'just another ' + 'string'
puts var

var = 5 * (1+2)
puts var

var1 = 8
var2 = var1
puts var1
puts var2

puts ''

var1 = 'eight'
puts var1
puts var2
